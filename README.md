# Coffee Machine

The goal of this project was to create the code for a coffee machine that has the following basic functionalities:

1. Make 3 hot flavors (espresso, latte, and cappuccino), each with a unique recipe
2. Coin-operated (uses pennies, dimes, nickels, and quarters)
3. Can report on ingredient amounts in the coffee machine

The recipes for the 3 hot flavors are as follows:
- Espresso: 50ml water, 18g coffee
- Latte: 200ml water, 24g coffee, 150ml milk
- Cappuccino: 250ml water, 24g coffee, 100ml milk

The prices for the 3 hot flavors are as follows:
- Espresso: $1.50
- Latte: $2.50
- Cappuccino: $3.00

The coffee machine starts preloaded with the following ingredients:
- 300ml water
- 200ml milk
- 100g coffee

This program has the following requirements:
1. Can print a report on the amount of available ingredients
2. Check ingredient amounts to see if anything needs to be added
3. Process coins
4. Check the success of the transaction (inserting coins and buying a coffee, with change)
5. Make the coffee, subtracting the ingredients and returning the correct change, with a successful statement
